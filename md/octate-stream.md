### **`application/octet-stream`** (Simple Explanation)

`application/octet-stream` is a **default MIME type** used to represent **binary data** when the exact file type is unknown. It's like a "catch-all" type when the server doesn't know what kind of file it is dealing with.

#### What does "octet-stream" mean?
- **"Octet"** refers to 8-bit bytes.
- **"Stream"** means that the data is sent as a continuous flow.

So, **`application/octet-stream`** just means "this is raw binary data" and can be anything from an image, video, or executable file, but the server can't specifically identify what type of file it is.

### When is `application/octet-stream` used?
- When the file type is **unknown**, and the server cannot determine the appropriate MIME type.
- When downloading files like **executable programs**, **compressed archives** (like `.zip` or `.rar`), or other files that the server does not have a specific MIME type for.

### What happens with `application/octet-stream`?
When a file is served with this MIME type, the browser doesn't know how to handle it directly (like displaying it), so it often triggers a **download prompt**. For example:
- If the server sends a file with `Content-Type: application/octet-stream`, your browser will usually prompt you to download the file instead of trying to open it.

### Example in Your Code:
In your code, there's a fallback to `application/octet-stream`:
```js
const contentType = mimeType[extName] || "application/octet-stream";
```

- This line is saying: "If I can't find a specific MIME type for the file extension, just treat it as `application/octet-stream`."
- So, if the server is asked for a file with an unknown extension (for example, `.xyz`), it will respond with:
    ```http
    Content-Type: application/octet-stream
    ```
  This tells the browser, "I don't know what this file is, but here it is as raw binary data."

### Summary:
- **`application/octet-stream`** is used when the file type is unknown.
- It tells the browser to handle the file as raw binary data, which usually results in the browser offering the file as a download.
- It’s a safe default for serving files when you don’t know their MIME type.

In general, `application/octet-stream` ensures the file gets delivered, but it leaves it up to the user (or their system) to decide how to handle the file.
