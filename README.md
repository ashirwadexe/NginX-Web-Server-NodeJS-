### Summary of How the Server Works

1. **Setting Up the Server**:
   - The server is created using the `http` module, listening on port 3000.

2. **Handling Requests**:
   - When a client (like a web browser) makes a request, the server processes the request using a callback function.

3. **Determining the File to Serve**:
   - The server checks the requested URL. If the root URL (`/`) is requested, it serves the `index.html` file. Otherwise, it serves the file that matches the requested URL.

4. **Determining the File Type**:
   - The server determines the file's extension using `path.extname()` to identify the appropriate **MIME type** (like `text/html` for HTML files or `image/png` for PNG images). If the file type is unknown, it defaults to `application/octet-stream`.

5. **Reading the File**:
   - The server attempts to read the specified file using `fs.readFile()`. 

6. **Error Handling**:
   - If the file is not found (error code `ENOENT`), it responds with a **404 Not Found** message.
   - If there's a different error, it responds with a **500 Internal Server Error** message, including the error code.

7. **Sending the Response**:
   - If the file is read successfully, the server responds with a **200 OK** status and sends the file's content to the client.

### Overall Flow:
1. Client requests a file (like `index.html`).
2. Server determines which file to serve based on the request.
3. Server reads the file and checks for errors.
4. Server responds with the appropriate status code and the file content or an error message. 

This setup allows the server to serve static files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) to clients efficiently.
